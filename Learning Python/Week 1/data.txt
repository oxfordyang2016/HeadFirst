If you are accustomed to planning large-scale test efforts in advance, it may be
tempting to plan out all your charters before you begin executing against them.
The problem is that you cannot know until you start exploring what kind of
information you will find. If you plan all your charters in advance, you will be
less able to adjust your exploration to take that new information into account.
You might identify some of the most important charters in advance. However,
chartering is not the same as traditional test planning. It is a much more fluid
process. You are constantly revisiting your charters throughout the entire
development life cycle to make sure you're always focused on discovering the
information your stakeholders care most about. To put it another way, take your
exploration one mission at a time.
